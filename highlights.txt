This transcript appears to be lyrics from a song, rather than a spoken-word piece with distinct moments.  There isn't a narrative structure that allows for the identification of specific "engaging or insightful moments" in the way a typical video transcript would.  The lyrics express themes of overcoming hardship and believing in oneself, but these are consistently repeated throughout the song rather than concentrated in particular sections.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide timestamps for specific engaging moments.
